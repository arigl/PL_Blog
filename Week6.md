Syntax of Lambda Calculus:

Overview:
Lambda Calculus has three constructs
- Abstraction
  - Basis: Î»x.e
  - Components:
    - e: is a program
    - x: is a variable
    - Basis: program (or function) which as a formal parameter of x
    - This is known as an abstraction because the basis does not depend on the variable x anymore 
- Application
  - Basis: e1e2
  - If e1 and e2 are programs, then the basis is teh program which applies e1 to e2
- Variables
  - The basic programs are just variables
