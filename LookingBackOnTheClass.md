<h1> My impressions of the class: Programming Languages </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

I was pretty scared going into this class orginally. A lot of people told me how hard it was, and honestly it didn't really seemed like it was what I wanted to do in my career, so I figured this class would be one of those experiences I needed to get over with.

People really didn't exagerate when they said this class was hard, but I really appreciated the ways in which this class was hard. None of the things that were asked of us were unreasonable, everything had a clear purpose that advances your fundamental understanding on how to approach computer programming. It develops a more inherent understanding of modern programming languages, where you understand how powerful they are. 

However, I do feel the approach for the final exam should be reconsidered. Every class this semester had a take home exam, making it impossible to put in the amount of time needed to excel on every one of them. This exam was simply too long and difficult given the circumstances, and the overall length should be made shorter in order to make sure students are not completly overwhelmed. 

<h3> Things I liked: </h3>

- After spending a lot of time working on a tedious error or function, and finally seeing it compile is an awesome feeling. Certain things did not come easily to me, and finally understanding how things worked made things a lot easier. Taking the time to understand the material rather than just seeing what sticked really worked for me.
- Working in a group was incredibly important, and I lucked out with a great team. There were a lot of times where I would get stuck on a problem where my partner was able to help me, and vice versa. The assignments we had were not something I could have done by myself to be completly honest, but I feel like I learned a lot from my experience. 

<h3> Things I did not like: </h3>

- The overall amount of really weird errors that I got were very fustrating. Simple things such as installing Haskell were way harder than it should have been, and took a lot longer than anyone expected. There were moments were you hit a brick wall simply due to errors no one has experienced before. 


<h3> Things I wish I approached Differently </h3>
  
- For the first exam, I felt like I studied in the completly wrong direction. I studied every single thing in my notes, whether it was on the posts made by our teacher or youtube tutorials online, but really all that was on the exam was the practice test. I don't think that was really a bad thing, I just wish I knew going into it how similar it was going to be. I feel like I could have done much better if I spent more time on the practice exam, but I did learn alot in the process so I suppose its a mixed bag.
