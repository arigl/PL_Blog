We will be going over the basics of what an ARS is, as well as learning about Confluence and Normal Forms 

<h2> Overview </h2>
Definition: An abstract reduction system (ARS) is a set A together with a relation -> →⊆ A × A.

- elements of A can be any types of elements: numbers, strings, lists, trees, etc. 
- a∈A is a normal form if there is no (a,b)∈→, or, if there is no a→b.
