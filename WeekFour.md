<h1>Why learning Haskell and other functional programming languages is important.</h1>

My first thought going into Programming Languages was that it would be another theoritical class I wouldn't use. Often in higher education, you don't really have much of a choice in what classes to take, so typically I go into the classes with the mindset of getting through it. 

However, once I began working in Haskell I knew this class would be instrumental to my programming foundation. It teaches you to view programming from a different perspective, which helps you view projects at a more fundamental level. 

Instead of simply manipulating a function you already know works, Programming Languages teaches you to view it a deeper perspective, which allows you to understand the foundational aspects more. 

By having a deeper understanding, it improves your overall programming efficiency when utilizing different functions you have a better understanding of.
